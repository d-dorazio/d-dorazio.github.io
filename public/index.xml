      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s just common knowledge that pressing Ctrl-C will usually terminate a long running command in a shell. How cool is that? But, how does it work?
Every developer that has done some little system programming on Linux knows that the answer is signals. They are defined in the POSIX standard and are a (very) limited form of inter-process communication. The idea is really simple: a signal is sent to a program to notify it that an event has occured.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer based in Florence with a strong passion for open source and free software.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently employed at Develer. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing company where I work with great people on great projects and no, they didn&amp;rsquo;t pay me to say that. The cool thing is that Develer does literally everything, from low-level embedded projects to the most innovative websites. This way I&amp;rsquo;ve got the chance to explore all the sides of software developing.</description>
