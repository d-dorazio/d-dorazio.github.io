I am a developer working at [develer](https://develer.com) where I can build a
lot of cool stuff working with great people. Currently I'm working on a 3D CAD
for fashion shoes that runs in the broser!

My interests are functional programming and programming language design.

This blog will collect my ramblings about whatever I find interesting or worth
to be written down.

If you wish to reach out to me, you can find me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/danieled__) and
[github](https://github.com/d-dorazio).
