I am a developer [@Develer](https://develer.com) where I can build a lot of cool stuff
with great people. My main interests are functional programming and programming language
design.

This blog will collect my ramblings about whatever I find interesting or worth to be
written down.

If you wish to reach out to me, you can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/danieled__) and [github](https://github.com/d-dorazio).
