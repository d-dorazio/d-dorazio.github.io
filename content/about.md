I am a developer working at [develer](https://develer.com) where I can build a
lot of cool stuff working with great people. My main interests are functional
programming and programming language design. In my spare time I like solving
twisty puzzles like the [megaminx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megaminx), but
my favourite one is the plain old Rubik's cube of course. I am not fast by any
means though :sweat_smile: but I enjoy the experience a lot.

This blog will collect my ramblings about whatever I find interesting or worth
to be written down.

If you wish to reach out to me, you can find me on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/danieled__) and
[github](https://github.com/d-dorazio).
