+++

I'm a software developer based in Florence with a strong passion for open source and

I'm currently employed at [Develer](https://develer.com). It's an amazing company where I work
with great people on great projects and no, they didn't pay me to say that.
The cool thing is that Develer does literally everything, from low-level embedded projects to
the most innovative websites. This way I've got the chance to explore all the sides of software
developing.

I haven't got a favourite programming language, but I enjoy writing in Haskell and Rust.

### What's this blog all about?
This blog will contain my ramblings about whatever I find interesting or worth to be
written down. I don't really expect anyone to read(and like) any of my posts, because I'm writing for
myself only.
