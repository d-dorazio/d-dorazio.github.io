I've just finished watching
[Interstellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)) for probably
the 7th time since it came out and I really enjoy it every time. The soundtrack
is amazing and it adds a completely new dimension to the movie. The plot is
literally mind blowing, but I know that a lot of people don't get it. I don't
care, I understand the amount of pieces I need to find it interesting and that's
enough for me. It should come as no surprise that Interstellar is one of my
favourite movies. If you haven't watched it yet then stop reading and go watch
it.

Anyway, I've digressed enough, let's talk about new my year's resolutions. I
know I'm kind of late to the party since 2018 started more than a week ago, but
here I am nonetheless. The reason why I'm writing this down is that I believe
that by sharing it publicly I'll feel obliged in actually pursuing my goals. So
here are my new year's resolutions:

- first of all, I'd like to start writing blog posts for real this time. I
  actually started this blog more than a year ago, but I only published a single
  post since then. The reasons why I want to have a blog didn't change. I find
  myself thinking a lot about many different problems and I think that by
  writing them down they'll become more clear in my head. If other people find
  them interesting then that's a bonus point :smile:. I also want to improve at
  writing(in English) and at exposing ideas in general. I think I'm pretty bad
  at the latter and I really want to improve.
- I plan on doing some public talks mostly for the same reasons I want to have
  this blog. I already have some ideas for an introductory workshop on
  functional programming concepts. Stay tuned for a blog post in case I give
  this talk.
- build something useful. I feel like I didn't build or learn much in the past
  year and that really sucks. I definitely want to do something this year
  though. Whatever I'll build, I'll use either Haskell or Rust, because those
  are my top 2 languages as of now. I know this is pretty vague, but bear with
  me.

Let's hope for a great new year!
